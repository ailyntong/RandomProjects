Pathfinder 
by Neelay Junnarkar

This project is an implementation of of several pathfinding algorithms on a square grid.

While running, the program animates the display, updating as the program runs

It includes:
 * Breadth-first Search
 * Greedy Breadth-first Search
 * Dijkstra's 
 * A*

Output Display Legend:
 * Green Cell - Start
 * Red Cell - Goal
 * Green-tinted Cells - cells that have not been visited
 * Red-tinted Cells - cells that have been visited
 * Weight is represented by shades of gray: the lighter the cell, the less weight it is
 * Black Cells - not nodes in the graph (intraversable)
